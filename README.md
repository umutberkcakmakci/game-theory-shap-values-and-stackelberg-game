This study presents the findings of an empirical investigation introducing an innovative approach to investigate the decision-making process computed by machine learning algorithms regarding wearable sensor data in human activity recognition and how to enhance it using game theory principles. Traditional classification algorithms usually face major challenges when dealing with high dimensional datasets and an extremely large number of features, which can be highly inefficient and very costly. If we were able to calculate the importance of each feature and decide which ones to use, this would be very effective and beneficial for recognizing human activity. This study utilizes the Shapley value computation technique to determine the importance of features in machine learning models and employs the Stackelberg game framework to decide which ones to use immediately and which ones to use later (optimal sequencing of feature usage). The study presents experimental results and analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Overall, using the publicly available datasets, the research provides valuable insights into the decisionmaking process in human activity recognition and opens up possibilities for further research in the field.
